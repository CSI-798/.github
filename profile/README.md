# CSI 798 â€” Predictive Vision Research

## Overview
CSI 798 is a research group focused on **predicting actions from visual data** by combining **computer vision**, **neural networks**, and **large language models (LLMs)**.

Our goal is to explore methods that allow AI systems to go beyond recognition and **anticipate future actions** in dynamic environments.

## Research Themes
- **Action Classification**: Determining what an action is based on the video that is shown.  
- **Multimodal Learning**: Integrating images, video, and text representations.  
- **LLM Integration**: Leveraging language models for reasoning and interpretability.

## Repository Structure
The organization contains the following repositories:

- **ðŸ“‚ Research/** â€” Papers, literature reviews, experiment notes, and reports.  
- **ðŸ“‚ Data/** â€” Datasets, preprocessing scripts, and data handling utilities.  
- **ðŸ“‚ Code/** â€” Implementations of models, training pipelines, and analysis tools.
